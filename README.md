> **"24 hours. That’s all we had."**

Cuneiform was developed by **Team ARNE DEV** during **Code Kalari**, a national-level 24-hour hackathon organized by IIIT Kottayam. Our goal was to bridge the gap between students and administration with a transparent, real-time feedback loop.

## 🧩 The Problem
In large institutions, complaints about maintenance, Wi-Fi, or sanitation often disappear into a black hole.
- ❌ **Lack of Transparency:** Students don't know if their issue was seen.
- ❌ **Duplicate Overload:** Admins are bombarded with the same reports.
- ❌ **No Prioritization:** Critical issues get lost in the noise.

## 💡 The Solution
**Cuneiform** is a smart, real-time dashboard that keeps everyone accountable. It uses AI and community voting to ensure the most important problems are solved first.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis
The system automatically detects **urgency** and **sentiment**.
- Flags words like "Fire" or "Leak" as **Critical** immediately.
- Gauges user frustration to help admins prioritize.

### 🗳️ Community Voting
A Reddit-style upvote system allows the community to highlight pressing issues. If 50 students upvote "Wi-Fi Down," it naturally floats to the top.

### 👻 Anonymous Reporting
Encourages honest feedback by allowing students to report issues without revealing their identity.

### 🔒 Evidence Locker
Users can attach photos and videos to their complaints because "seeing is believing."

### 🔐 Private Mode
Sensitive issues can be locked so they are visible only to the admins.
